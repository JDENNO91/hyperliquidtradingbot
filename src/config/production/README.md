## ‚öôÔ∏è Switching Between Timeframes

All strategies can run on different timeframes by changing `data_file` and `timeframe`:

```json
{
  "data_file": "src/backtesting/data/ETH-PERP/ETH-PERP-{TIMEFRAME}-7d.json",
  "trading": {
    "timeframe": "{TIMEFRAME}"
  }
}
```

Available timeframes:
- `1m` - 10,080 candles (7 days)
- `5m` - 2,016 candles (7 days) ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
- `10m` - 1,008 candles (7 days)
- `15m` - 672 candles (7 days)
- `30m` - 336 candles (7 days)
- `1h` - 168 candles (7 days)

## üìù Notes

- All backtests use 7 days of synthetic ETH-PERP data
- Real-world results may vary (expect 50-100% monthly realistic range)
- Always paper trade before going live
- Monitor performance and adjust parameters as needed
- ETH-PERP outperforms BTC-PERP for these strategies (higher volatility)

1. Choose strategy based on your style/goals
2. Run backtest to verify results
3. Paper trade for 7-14 days
4. Monitor and validate performance
